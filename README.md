# pkcore AKA Rust for Failures AKA Spawn of [Fudd](https://github.com/ImperialBower/fudd)

🚧 **Work In Progress** 🚧

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) poker library. Code inspired by [Cactus Kev's](https://suffe.cool)
[work in C](https://suffe.cool/poker/code/). An isolated version of the core hand evaluation library is available at [ckc-rs](https://github.com/ContractBridge/ckc-rs).

Currently only supports [hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em), but working on [Omaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_hold_%27em) and want to add more types of games. Supporting
things like [Razz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razz_(poker)) would be a total kick.

This code is a complete rewrite from scratch of my [Fudd](https://github.com/ImperialBower/fudd) crate. Changes:

* Folded [ckc-rs](https://github.com/ContractBridge/ckc-rs) crate into the repo.
* Folded [wincounter](https://github.com/ImperialBower/wincounter) crate into the repo.
* Removed [cardpack.rs](https://github.com/ImperialBower/cardpack.rs) dependency

## TODO:

* Roadmap
* Clear release breakdowns.

## Examples

Check out the examples directory for various ways to use the library. 

The best example is [calc](examples/calc.rs), which allows you to do a breakdown of the odds of a specific hand
of poker. Here it is running [the famous hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjM60lqRhPg) quads vs full
house between Gus Hansen and Daniel Negreanu on High Stakes Poker:

```shell
❯ cargo run --example calc -- -d "6s 6h 5d 5c" -b "9c 6d 5h 5d 8d"
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.10s
     Running `target/debug/examples/calc -d '6s 6h 5d 5c' -b '9c 6d 5h 5d 8d'`
DEALT: [6♠ 6♥, 5♦ 5♣] FLOP: 9♣ 6♦ 5♥, TURN: 5♦, RIVER: 8♦

    OUTS: 5♠

The River: 8♦
 Winning Hand: 271-SixesOverFives
   Player #1: 6♠ 6♥ 6♦ 5♥ 5♦ - 271-SixesOverFives WINS!
   Player #2: 5♥ 5♦ 5♣ 9♣ 8♦ - 2249-ThreeFives

cargo run --example calc -- -d  "6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣" -b "9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♦ 8♦"
Elapsed: 467.50ms
```

Add the -n flag and it will add all possible hands at the flop, sorted by strength:

```shell
❯ cargo run --example calc -- -d "6s 6h 5d 5c" -b "9c 6d 5h 5d 8d" -n

  Player #2 [5♦ 5♣] 6.0% (4.34%/1.62%) [43/16]

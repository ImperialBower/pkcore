/// # REFACTOR
///
/// Decided to rename this struct as `HoleCards`. Hands is too generic a name for it.
/// A `Hand` can be what you are holding, as well as the final best collection of five cards
/// combining what's in your hand as well as what's on the board.
///
/// Later on, when we start dealing with games like [Omaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_hold_%27em)
/// we're going to need to do some refactoring for these types into generics so that we can support
/// a number of different games. This is something we are saving for later. You don't want to
/// go crazy with the design of your library. Let its design flow from the use cases you implement.
/// That way you avoid tying yourself into a programmatic pretzel.
///
/// This is one of the main reasons I like focusing on the core domain library for a system first.
/// You will often encounter code where the classes don't have logical names, or they're too vague.
/// You can see the seams of the work where they had to make major last minute renovations of the
/// code where it starts to strain against the new demands put upon it. This is always a risk, but
/// it is greatly reduced if you don't subject it to demands outside its core functionality.
///
/// Right now, I can code, get what I want, see that it's starting to get out of hand, and make
/// major refactorings without having to worry about breaking external systems that are dependent
/// on it. Later on, we will need to be much more careful. Enjoy your isolation while you can. It
/// is fleeting.

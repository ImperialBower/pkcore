/// I am a classicist when it comes to testing. Martin Fowler, in his essay
/// [Mocks Aren't Stubs](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)
/// breaks down the styles of TDD into classical and mockist:
///
/// > The classical TDD style is to use real objects if possible and a double if it's awkward to use the real thing. So a classical `TDDer` would use a real warehouse and a double for the mail service. The kind of double doesn't really matter that much.
/// >
/// > A mockist TDD practitioner, however, will always use a mock for any object with interesting behavior. In this case for both the warehouse and the mail service.
///
/// Now, the norm where I work is to code in a mockist style. As a developer, I try to understand
/// the different styles and be able to do both. Even though I would much rather inject pure state
/// into my objects, in the classical style, it's useful to be able to do both.
///
/// Now one of my favorite programmers, [Dan Wiebe](https://github.com/dnwiebe), is a hard core
/// mockist, and has used his considerable fundamentalist will-to-power foo to make the challenge
/// that rust brings to mocking possible in the code bases that he has worked with.

/// OK, we've hit a snag. There's not one Eval for the nuts with any given flop. For instance, there

///
/// * 9â™£ 8â™  7â™  6â™¦ 5â™¥ - 1605: `NineHighStraight`

///
/// We're either going to have to find a better data structure, or distill our vector down to only
/// one entry for each `HandRank`.
///
/// Sigh... this is one of the harder things about programming. You've gotten all your nice little
/// programmatic ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦† in a row only to discover that it just doesn't work. Hours and hours
/// of testing all needing to be redone. Time to light a match, and watch it burn.
///
/// So, I'm going to need to refactor `TheNuts`. Here's what I'm thinking:
///
/// ```
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
/// use pkcore::hand_rank::eval::Eval;
/// use pkcore::hand_rank::HandRank;
///
/// pub struct TheNuts(HashMap<HandRank, Vec<Eval>>);
/// ```
///
/// A collection containing all the possible `Evals` for a specific `HandRank`. The problem is,
/// a vector can have dupes. What about something like this:
///
/// ```
///
/// use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
/// use pkcore::hand_rank::eval::Eval;
/// use pkcore::hand_rank::HandRank;
///
/// pub struct TheNuts(HashMap<HandRank, HashSet<Eval>>);
/// ```
///
/// One potential problem with that though is that an Eval with the exact same hand, but with the
/// cards in different order, could be seen as a different eval. This problem stems from the hand
/// element in the `Eval` struct. Two different orders of the same hand are not seen as equal:
///
/// ```
/// use pkcore::card::Card;
///
/// let royal_flush_1 = [
///     Card::ACE_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::KING_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::QUEEN_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::JACK_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::TEN_DIAMONDS,
/// ];
///
/// let royal_flush_2 = [
///     Card::KING_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::ACE_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::QUEEN_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::JACK_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::TEN_DIAMONDS,
/// ];
///
/// assert_ne!(royal_flush_1, royal_flush_2)
/// ```
///
/// Evan though these are exactly the same hands, from a pure data representation, the cards are in
/// a different order, so they are different. What we need, is a way to override equal for `Five`
/// and `Eval`.
///
/// Let's try test-driving this through `Five` and then see if there's a way for it to cascade down
/// to `Pile` so that it can apply to any collection of cards.
///
/// So, we've figured out a way to implement an equality test for `Five` that ignores card order:
///
/// ```
/// use pkcore::arrays::five::Five;
/// use pkcore::card::Card;
/// fn eq(a: Five, b: Five) -> bool {
///     let mut a = a.to_arr();
///     a.sort();
///
///     let mut b = b.to_arr();
///     b.sort();
///
///     a == b
/// }
///
/// let royal_flush_1 = Five::from([
///     Card::ACE_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::KING_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::QUEEN_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::JACK_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::TEN_DIAMONDS,
/// ]);
///
/// let royal_flush_2 = Five::from([
///     Card::KING_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::ACE_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::QUEEN_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::JACK_DIAMONDS,
///     Card::TEN_DIAMONDS,
/// ]);
///
/// assert!(eq(royal_flush_1, royal_flush_2));
/// ```
///
/// The problem with using this functionality for a manual implementation of the `PartialEq` trait
/// is that clippy complains "you are deriving `Hash` but have implemented `PartialEq` explicitly".
///
/// This feels like we're falling down a rabbit's hole. I really don't want to be overriding the
/// default implementations of `PartialEq` and `Hash` if I don't really have to, especially for a
/// fundamental data type like `Five`. It's designed to be simple and fast.
///
/// I can think of three ways of dealing with this edge case:
///
/// 1. Ignoring it until it because a real issue.
/// 2. Forcing a sort everytime you instantiate a `HandRank` struct.
/// 3. `Bard`!!!
///
/// What's a `Bard` you ask? Let's go over to that file and find out.
///
/// OK, now that you're back, I've come to the conclusion that I am once again overthinking the
/// problem. One of the really great things about pair programming, is that you always have someone
/// there calling you on your bullshit. _Do we really need that?_ _What exactly is the point?_ _Does
/// this have anything to do with the story we're working on?_
///
/// When I am flying solo, like right now, I will often take some wild detours exploring strange
/// corners, and enjoy what I might find a long the way. When I started on `Fudd` this was one of
/// the fun things about working on it. Just playing with the code. Seeing what I could do with it.
///
/// The two things that are really holding me back are I want to create a tight library that others,
/// including me, can use to crete cool shit, and that voice in the back of my head warning me that
/// you, gentle reader, will be suffering through my ramblings. For this role, I always have that
/// wise sage [Gold Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kObBphkNiU) counselling me,
/// _"Stay on target! STAY ON TARGET!!!"_

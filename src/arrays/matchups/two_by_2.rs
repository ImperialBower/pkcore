    /// cards. Our struct already checks to make sure that our cards are actually cards
    /// with `is_dealt()` from our `Two` struct. We could be super careful and validate
    /// things again, but that would just clutter up the method with a lot of duplicate
    /// code. Being careful is one thing, but it's important to do it at the right place
    /// at the right time so that your code isn't just safe, but also elegant and maintainable.
    /// This is why, for this moment, I'm going to skip checking for negative boundary conditions.
    ///
    /// Having said that, we are always on the lookout for defects in our code, and other tests
    /// may uncover something, and then we will adjust accordingly. How, when, and where you
    /// test your code is just as important to your craft as how you code your code itself. I would
    /// maintain that it's even more important.
    ///
    /// Let's test drive this method using Queenbury Rules. We'll
    /// write one failing test for our first scenario, which is
    /// that for a specific board, the first player wins.
    ///
    /// OK, so we have our first test passing with the simplest method possible. Now let's
    /// write one for the second player winning.
    ///
    /// ## ASIDE
    ///
    /// I'll be honest with you, returning to this `Win` constants, I really hate them. The fact
    /// that they aren't just a `Win` struct seems ridiculous to me. I know I've complained about
    /// them before, but very soon I'm going to need to do a major refactoring of them to clean
    /// up the code. The big lesson of this is to avoid type aliases unless you have a very good
    /// reason, and the only reason I can think of is to make it easier to communicate what the
    /// type is doing, without the need for a lot of custom code.
    ///
    /// ## Back to the second test
    ///
    /// A note on the contract for this method. The `HandRanker` trait that `Seven` implements
    /// returns not only the `HandRankValue` for the hand, but also a `Five` representing the best
    /// possible hand. We're discarding that because we don't see any use for it. It's good to
    /// make a note of things like this. Could there be a use for this data? Given the volume
    /// of evaluations that we will be doing, I don't think so, but you never know.
    ///
    /// Now, we're hitting another problem with using a type alias for our `HandRankValue`.
    /// While we were all fancy with our `HandRank` struct in overriding the sorting for it
    /// so that the lower the value of `HandRankValue` the greater the value for `HandRank`,
    /// making comparisons nice and easy.
    ///
    /// For this method, since we only have the `HandRank` we will need to invert the method.
    /// This isn't a big deal, but it does make me hate my infatuation with type aliases. For
    /// now we will do that, and make a TODO RF at `HandRankValue`.
    ///
    /// Done. Now let's deal with a tie. The simplest way is for the board to just be a straight
    /// flush with Aâ™  Kâ™  Qâ™  Jâ™  Tâ™ .
    ///
    /// Now this is weird... we have a false positive. This is a great example of things to watch
    /// out for in our tests. When we copied it over we didn't adjust it to set the expected
    /// result to be a tie. Let's fix that.
    ///
    /// That's better. Always make sure it fails before you make it pass. There are few things more
    /// dangerous to a codebase than a falsely passing test.
    ///
    /// There is one dangerous negative boundary condition for this code:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use std::str::FromStr;
    /// use pkcore::arrays::matchups::two_by_2::TwoBy2;
    /// use pkcore::arrays::two::Two;
    /// use pkcore::play::board::Board;
    ///
    /// let hands = TwoBy2{first: Two::default(), second: Two::HAND_AS_AH};
    /// let board = Board::from_str("Aâ™  Kâ™  Qâ™  Jâ™  Tâ™ ").unwrap();
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Right now `hands.win_for_board(&board)` returns a tie.
    ///
    /// ## The Fix
    ///
    /// So, do you fix the bizarro edge case and complicate the code, or do we
    /// ignore it for now and add a technical debt marker into our code?
    ///
    /// I'm going for the technical debt route. I'll ignore our failing test for now and add the
    /// TODO to it.
    ///
    /// Before I close out this edge case, I noticed something from `Seven`. When I pass in a
    /// blank Two struct into `Seven::from_case_and_board()` it doesn't return an eval of 0.
    /// Let's write a test over in `Seven` to isolate this.
    ///
    /// OK, so we've fixed the Seven issue. Now, I'm feeling stupid. Rather than coding this
    /// using the `hand_rank_value_and_hand()` method why not just use `hand_rank_and_hand()`
    /// instead? This does force each permutation to do a little more work, but it is also
    /// cleaner. Let's try it and see what happens.
    ///
    /// TODO POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATION: Use `hand_rank_value_and_hand()` VS `hand_rank_and_hand()`
    ///
    /// Frack it. I'm going back to what was and moving on. ABC: always be closing. I hate how much
    /// I get caught up in edge cases that take a ton of time and aren't really realistic.
    ///
    /// ## Aside
    ///
    /// Clippy wants me to use a match instead of if else. Frack that. I'm
    /// not doing it.

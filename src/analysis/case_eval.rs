/// # Analysis Saga: Step 2
///
/// A `CaseEval` is a collection of `Evals` for a specific selection of `Cards`, or case.
/// While a `Eval` is able to return the best possible hand for a specific player given
/// a specific collection of cards, a `CaseEval` is able to compare the evaluations for all
/// the players in the collection and returns the ones that are winners. This needs to be a
/// collection because it is possible for more than one player to have the best hand.
///
/// One big refactoring that I am doing over my initial Fudd spike is that there I had
/// [an intermediate struct](https://github.com/ContractBridge/fudd/blob/main/src/games/holdem/seat_eval.rs)
/// that held the players seat number, and if they had folded or not, in addition to the `Eval`.
/// This was me trying to code game play in addition to analysis... in other words, getting ahead
/// of itself. For now, let's stick to pure analysis. A vector has an inherent index location, so
/// I don't need to store a seat number.
///
/// Our goal is to lock down analysis, and then later on add game play, where the positions of game
/// play are constantly rotating with the dealer button. Seat is a relative term, not fixed, and
/// so the seat number of the player is totally different than the player's identity. By trying to
/// do too much, I made it much harder to build upon my foundation. One step at a time. Thin slices,
/// as it were.
///
/// ## Question:
///
/// As I work through this would it be wise to harden this class by making it an
/// `[IndexSet](https://docs.rs/indexmap/latest/indexmap/set/struct.IndexSet.html)` like `Cards`?
/// This would make sure that I can't pass in the same eval twice. For now, I'm going to hold off.
///
/// My general rule for hardening my code is based on how close it is to the hub of the wheel.
/// `Cards` is at the center of everything. I really don't want to have to worry about defects
/// related to accidentally passing in the same card twice. Thanks to `IndexSet` that `defect vector`
/// is taken off the table.
///
/// `CaseEval` is several steps removed from the center of the API we are building. All of the hands
/// being folded in are based on `Cards`. Yes, a defect is possible, but it would be a challenge to
/// introduce it into the system.
///
/// I believe in learning systems. You, as a developer; team; group; company, make
/// the best estimate as to what your definition of quality is. You build for that. As your system
/// is put through its paces, you treat any defects that come out as opportunities to learn from
/// your mistakes, and harden. The risk of introducing regression defects is in direct, inverse
/// proportion to the quality of your test coverage. This is one of the most fundamental reasons
/// that we test our code. How can we build a learning system if every time we try to update it,
/// based on what we've learned in the field, we pose a significant risk of making it worst?
///
/// Why do you think our government is littered with software they can't upgrade?
///
/// I make a good living cleaning up after the large companies full of managers who don't understand
/// this concept. They look to control and blame others for the mistakes they cause by being too
/// short-sighted to build learning systems. They are drowning, and don't even know it. Personally,
/// I'd rather help them build additional value for their companies, instead of cleaning up after
/// 10xers too smart for their own good. Please, help me code myself out of a job.
///
///
/// TODO: Section on defect vectors
///
/// ## Version 2 : Adding case
///
/// In order to have a way to consolidate the outs for a specific hand, we're adding a
/// `Cards` struct to give a common context behind the specific `Case`.
///
/// ### Done
///
/// Now comes the hard part. We've got the `Outs` `Card` for each `CaseEval`, now we have to
/// turn that into a functioning outs...
///
/// Actually, it's not as hard as it looks. We already have `Outs.add_from_player_flag()`, which
/// has all of the core logic we need. How about we add an `Outs.add_from_case_eval()` and
/// call it a day?

    ///
    /// For this one we're going to add what they call in poker as the nuts.
    ///
    /// > A common and certainly apocryphal folk etymology is that the term originated from the historical poker games in the colonial west of America, where if a player bet everything he possessed, he would place the nuts of his wagon wheels on the table to ensure that, should he lose, he would be unable to flee and would have to make good on the bet. Since it would be expected that a player would only make such a bet when he had the best possible hand, the folk lore says that this is how the best possible hand came to be known as the nuts. It is also rumored _[by whom?]_ that these historical games were played only in the winter, and therefore, the nuts that were placed on the table were "stone cold", hence coining the term "stone-cold-nuts". -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_hand#Origins)
    ///
    /// Now, for _the hand_, Daniel has flopped what is called _the third nuts_, meaning that
    /// as of the flop in play he has the third best possible hand of three sixes (6♠ 6♥ 6♦ 9♣ 8♠).
    /// There are only two hands that would be better than him at the flop. REMEMBER...
    /// as Daniel learned in _the hand_, just because you have the best hand at the flop
    /// doesn't mean that you will have the best hand at the river, or even that you have
    /// the best chances of winning.
    ///
    /// Here are the two hands that would be better than three sixes:
    /// * The Nuts: `Nine High Straight (9♣ 8♠ 7♠ 6♦ 5♥)`
    /// * 2nd Nuts: `Three Nines (9♠ 9♥ 9♣ 6♦ 5♥)`
    ///
    /// Let's add them as hands for evaluation at make a more complicated failing test:

    /// * Enumerate through every hand
    /// * Set the flag if that position in the vector has that `HandRank`.
    ///
    /// ## Test #2: TAKE TWO GREEN
    ///
    /// Now that we've gotten the test to pass, we can add a more complex test. What happens when
    /// more than one person wins. For instance, while it is impossible for more than one player
    /// to have three nines, sixes, or fives, it is possible for more than one person to flop a
    /// straight because there are many combinations of `87`. How many?
    ///
    /// There are four possible hands of suited connectors: `8♠ 7♠, 8♥ 7♥, 8♦ 7♦, 8♣ 7♣`.
    /// Twelve possible offsuit 87s: `8♠ 7♥, 8♠ 7♦, 8♠ 7♣, 8♥ 7♠, 8♥ 7♦, 8♥ 7♣, 8♦ 7♠, 8♦ 7♥, 8♥ 7♣,
    /// 8♣ 7♠, 8♣ 7♥, 8♣ 7♦`. That makes for 16 possible nut straight hands that are better than
    /// either Daniel's or Gus' hands, or three nines for that matter.
    ///
    /// While from a programming perspective this may seem like a tedious exercise, from a poker
    /// theory perspective it's important to understand how many possible hands are out there
    /// that can beat you, and what combinations are removed by what you are holding, aka
    /// [blockers](https://twitter.com/RossFrieser/status/1209900972023132160).

    /// I hate the name of that method and the name of the value it returns:
    /// `PlayerFlag`.
    ///
    /// To test out with a more complicated use case that would involve a four way
    /// tie, I'm going to use an alternative reality version of the hand that
    /// was played on High Stakes Poker season 4 episode 8, featuring
    /// Jennifer Harman and Bob Safai, where if a J♣ had come on the river it would have
    /// resulted in a four-way tie. Here's the original `Game`:
    /// `cargo run --example calc -- -d "A♣ Q♠ T♦ T♣ 6♦ 4♦ 2♥ 2♦" -b "J♦ J♠ J♥ A♥ 3♦"`
    ///
    /// To test our code, we're going to change the board just a little:
    /// `cargo run --example calc -- -d "A♣ Q♠ T♦ T♣ 6♦ 4♦ 2♥ 2♦" -b "J♦ J♠ J♥ A♥ J♣"`
    ///
    /// With this board, every player plays the board, although technically, player #1 could
    /// play the A♣ in their hand instead of the one on the board, but it wouldn't make any
    /// difference. For our library, it doesn't matter. One of the next level things that I want
    /// to work on later in this library is for the library to be able to distill down hand
    /// comparisons to their base equivalent values.
    ///
    /// For example: If I hold A♣ Q♠ and my opponent holds T♦ T♣, from an analysis point of view,
    /// that is the same as if I held A♥ Q♦. and they held T♠ T♥. My ace dominates their ten of the
    /// same suit, so that there is no way that they will beat me with a flush on the suit that
    /// matches my ace. Mathematically, A♣ Q♠ vs. T♦ T♣ is the same as A♥ Q♦ vs. T♠ T♥. I would like
    /// for this library to b able to take that into account when we get down to hand range
    /// analysis.
    ///
    /// ## ERROR
    ///
    /// Turns out that my original idea for this method is fatally flawed.
    /// ```txt
    /// pub fn winner(&self) -> (PlayerFlag, HandRank) {
    ///     let mut winning_rank = HandRank::default();
    ///     let mut player_flag = PlayerFlag::default();
    ///     for (i, eval) in self.0.iter().enumerate() {
    ///         if eval.hand_rank >= winning_rank {
    ///             player_flag = Win::or(player_flag, Win::from_index(i));
    ///             winning_rank = eval.hand_rank;
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///     (player_flag, winning_rank)
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// It can't be greater than or equal to. It has to only set the flag
    /// if the hand is the best hand, since as we loop through the evals
    /// the best hand is going to change as we discover better examples. This will
    /// require to passes, so we will just invert the calls, rolling back our
    /// old code to our original methods and then passing both back here.

/// For now we are going to work through our analysis needs from here. As the sophistication of our

///
/// The plan:
/// * Loop through every possible combination of turn and river cards.
///   * Eval the case for every player
///   * Generate a `wincounter::Count` for every case
///
/// NOTE TO SELF: Add performance testing to check weight of raw logging calls.

/// ## Thoughts
///
/// I've hit a wall. Even though I've done this before I feel like I'm starting over from scratch.
/// When I describe what programming is to people who don't do it for a living, I like to
/// tell them that it's like banging your head against the wall until you pass out, or
/// your head breaks through the wall. If you have a breakthrough, it's like a gambler's high
///
/// My goal right now is just go get this to work in its simplest form. Just do the
/// calculation and then refactor it into something flexible. I'm not test driving
/// right now. I'm spiking. I'm trying to flesh out how I will resolve this problem
/// before I take my discoveries and forge it into functioning, tested code.
///
/// I use the example command line programs as my playground. Rust is wonderful in letting
/// me use examples to play with ideas. I haven't seen a language that lets you do this
/// so easily.
///
/// ## STEP 3: `CaseEvals`
///
/// *AND WE'RE BACK!*
///
/// OK, we've finished coding `Eval`, and `CaseEval`. Now let's use our `PlayerWins` plugin
/// to work through the final steps.
///
/// For the record, I am not test driving this out. I'm going to let the `calc` command line
/// repl let me get feedback, and when we're in a good place, as in I can compare my results
/// to what we can find out through other sources, I will lock things down with tests.
///
/// There is no one right way to do things. At some point you need to trust your craft, and
/// know when to cute bait and regroup when you drive yourself into a ditch.
///
/// ### Step 3.1: Slow
///
/// I'm feeling like my logic is too slow, and I don't have enough feel for my code flow.
/// In these moments I want my code to be able to tell its story. There are a number of different
/// ways to do that. Testing is the primary way for me. The command line repls are another, allowing
/// me to kick the tires and verify that they are working.
///
/// However, there comes a point where your system starts to have a gravity of its own. A connection
/// of parts that work together. There is a beauty in these moments. The problem is, that it
/// becomes harder and hard to get a feel for how your code works. In military theory, it's called
/// [situational awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness).
/// The `DevOps` vanguard calls it [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability),
/// from the terms root's in mathematical control theory.
///
/// It is at this point in my coding adventures that I start feeling the need for logging.
///
/// I use the debug level of logging to tell me the outline version of my story.
///
/// #### Reflection
///
/// I'm starting to feel like this code is too smart for its own good. I don't feel like the program
/// flow justifies this level of abstraction. Questions:
///
/// * Do I need the `PlayOut` trait?
/// * Wouldn't it be better to just have a `Game` struct that simply collects the state of the Hand
///
/// #### Resolution
///
/// I've resolved to eliminate this struct altogether. While I was really excited about
/// learning how to create injectable logic based on traits, it really overcomplicates
/// things here. I can envision using this technique for things like alternative formes
/// of display, or a way to abstract things to allow for alternative types of poker
/// games, such as high/lo or `Razz`. For now, we'll hang this tool up in our workshop
/// until we really need it.

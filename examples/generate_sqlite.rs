/// Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a ballgame.
///
/// The thing is, that while I love having the ability to do this with the `BinaryCardMap`,
/// it's not really the data that I want to store in SQL. The reason is, that this datatype
/// is designed to accelerate determining the `HandRank` for specific combinations of cards,

/// doing the calculations millions of times per hand. Where storing values will really come in
/// handy is for caching preflop results. So let's close this chapter of our adventure, and
/// move on to that.
///
/// Oh... actually... there's one thing I want to try out first. I need a way to make sure
/// that a record is even there. Maybe `Option` is the way to go. Right now I'm just passing
/// down what comes from rusqlite, but now that I've got the code flow basically figured out,
/// I should be able to smooth down the edges and design a function contract that communicates
/// only what the caller needs to know.
///
/// This is going to require a major refactoring. Remember, before you refactor, commit. There's
/// nothing worst than getting trapped down a deep rabbit hole only to realize that you didn't
/// commit at a safe place before you fell in.
///
/// ASIDE: One thing you may be wondering is why I'm not test driving this whole adventure. The truth
/// is that I don't know how to code sqlite tests that stand up and tear down tables. This is
/// something I should figure out.
///
/// Right now, I'm using the same generated database over and over, and it's a real file. I don't
/// want to have to commit that to the repo. There has to be a better way. Back in the day I would
/// create this whole harness integration test thingy that would stand up and tear down databases
/// with every run. The tests were heavy, and required a running database connection. That was before

/// tototally over the top batshit crazy to require a database be running to prove out your code,

#### The Command Line

    In the Beginning...was the Command Line 
    -- Neal Stephenson

The command line is your first, and most important tool as a programmer. It has
been my constant companion over the course of my career. There are many command
lines. This one is mine. _examples_ ...


## The Crazy

I'm a programmer because I love programming. You need to find your crazy. It's
not for everyone, but that's OK. You can make those big tech bucks (LOL) without
touching code at all. Nerd wrangling is an art all its own. 

## CI

Set yourself so that you can be stupid. Don't require yourself to have to 
remember to constantly run `cargo test && cargo clippy && cargo fmt.` Assume
that failure is the normal human state, and you will give yourself a little
more room to breathe. Yes, I constantly run test and clippy and fmt, but if 
I don't, I have my trusty GitHub actions robot (_I call mine R4-P20_) to let me 
know if I forgot something, making sure that I won't push out something that 
will truly screw things up. Truly great programmers never make mistakes and are 
always infallible. They work for places that pay millions of dollars and never
ever ever do things like enable coups or create automated surveillance states. 
You will meet these people all the time. Alas, we are merely imposters, and so we
rely on our tools and craft to have our backs. Enjoy the freedom of not being 
perfect in every way. Being Superman means that you have to deal with the pain 
in the ass of being constantly asked to save the world. As imposters, we can 
go out and do things like walk our dogs, take naps and hug the ones we love. 

_Memento mori._

## Warning

I am the lover of strange writings. I was raised by a single, lesbian opera 
singer who's favorite author is Gertrude Stein. Zippy the Pinhead, Quasi at the 
Quackadero, Weirdo, Neat Stuff, American Flagg, Charles Bukowski, Armistead 
Maupin, Hunter S. Thompson, Gracie Allen, The Residents, John Waters, 
Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce are the perspectives that speak to me most. I have 
always been an outsider, and treasure that perspective. 

Also, when you pair with me, I will curse. I will say shit, and fuck, and fart, 
and if you are offended by these things, let me know. Personally, given we live
in a world where one of the political parties is openly condemning my mom's 
lifestyle, and kids being gunned down in their classrooms is the norm, I could
give a flying fuck about your delicate sensibilities. I have zero tollerance
for racism, sexism, misogyny, and prejudice toward people just trying to live the
most authentic version of their lives. If you have a problem with that, talk to
someone about how uncomfortable you get when you see two people of the same sex
holding hands, or why it offends you to have people of different races being
happy and living their lives. You may discover something very interesting about
yourself. *INSERT PROMO CODE FOR BETTER HEALTH HERE*

Consider yourself warned ;-)

## Test Driving, Thin Slicing, and My Chunnel Approach 

Domain Driven Design, the sweet spot between TDD and Architecture.

Perspective: [Why user stories and the thin slice are a lieâ€¦](https://hurlbert.medium.com/why-user-stories-and-the-thin-slice-are-a-lie-a3c393bde81#:~:text=In%20Agile%20there%20is%20lore,and%20implement%20the%20user%20story.)

The structure

* Core domain definitions
  * Hardened core API
    * Architecture defining system communication and interfaces
      * Display... i.e. applications

#### The Command Line

    In the Beginning...was the Command Line 
    -- Neal Stephenson

The command line is your first, and most important tool as a programmer. It has
been my constant companion over the course of my career. There are many command
lines. This one is mine. _examples_ ...


## The Crazy

I'm a programmer because I love programming. You need to find your crazy. It's
not for everyone, but that's OK. You can make those big tech bucks (LOL) without
touching code at all. Nerd wrangling is an art all its own. 

## CI

Set yourself so that you can be stupid. Don't require yourself to have to 
remember to constantly run `cargo test && cargo clippy && cargo fmt.` Assume
that failure is the normal human state, and you will give yourself a little
more room to breathe. Yes, I constantly run test and clippy and fmt, but if 
I don't, I have my trusty GitHub actions robot (_I call mine R4-P20_) to let me 
know if I forgot something, making sure that I won't push out something that 
will truly screw things up. Truly great programmers never make mistakes and are 
always infallible. They work for places that pay millions of dollars and never
ever ever do things like enable coups or create automated surveillance states. 
You will meet this people all the time. Alas, we are mearly 
imposters, and so we rely on our tools to have our backs. Enjoy the freedom
of not being perfect in every way. Being Superman means that you are constantly
having to save the world. As imposters, we can go out and do things like walk 
our dogs and hug people we love.

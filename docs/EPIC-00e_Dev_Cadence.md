# Dev Cadence

In every system, feedback is the essential ingredient. This is true when you are coding as well.

You always want your development loop to be made up of quick iterations. This is the essence of TDD:
Write a test that fails testing on one individual scenario , make it pass, refactor, repeat.
But this is even more true when you are just playing with stuff to see what works. _What they
call a spike in agile development._ Everytime you change something, you should try to make sure
that it works.

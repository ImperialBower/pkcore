# Dev Cadence

In every system, feedback is the essential ingredient. This is true when you are coding as well.

You always want your development loop to be made up of quick iterations. This is the essence of TDD:
Write a test that fails testing on one individual scenario , make it pass, refactor, repeat.
But this is even more true when you are just playing with stuff to see what works. _What they
call a spike in agile development._ Everytime you change something, you should try to make sure
that it works. 

## Your Lifeline

As you start to get on a roll with a specific problem, you will find yourself tearing through
functionality. You have the hot hand. You've finally figured it out and there's nothing to stop you now.

**STOP**

Take a deep breath every now and then and run this loop:

* Have I saved my work?
* Do my tests still pass?
* Is this a good time to commit?

As a developer you are a dungeon crawler, and functioning code and passing tests are your map. If you don't
take the time to update your map, you can quickly find yourself lost. 

Think of it as Doctor Strange would. Every crossroad... every decision... every condition... every step along
your system's path is another realm in the multiverse. Take too many steps along the way, and you will quickly 
find yourself lost... doomed to roll back your code to the last place you safely put on your map. 

Gentle readers... I am not pulling this advice out of my ass. This advice comes from a place of pain, for I...
**DUN DUN DUNNNNN** am that fool you recklessly grinded out features with a wonton bravado reserved by only
the basest of fools. You, too, will someday see yourself as one of those fools, but perhaps... just perhaps, 
these words will help you find the error of your ways sooner than I did. 

As I've said many times... your code is your hero... your tests are the chronicle of its journey. Forget to
record it, and their tale will quickly become lost.

# Preflop

Now that we've gotten some basic concurrency to speed up our odds calculations at the flop,
we're ready to start on the hardest calculation: Odds preflop.

Preflop is where the petal hits the metal.

When we were determining the odds at the flop heads up, we were iterating over 903 different unique
combination of cards that could be dealt. At the deal, that number increases to 1,712,304.
The effort to determine the exact odds is increasing geometrically.

Since these calculations are so heavy, we are going to need a plan. In fact, I'm thinking we're
going to need several plans:

1. Store the absolute results in some sort of DB, either flat file or simple text thing.
2. Some method of distilling down odds based on basic patters, such as two over cards vs pair, etc.

For this, I'm feeling the need to have a very simple way to store combinations of cards.

## Self doubt

I've walked down these corridors before. I feel like I am repeating myself. Still, I have a path
so I need to stick to it. I want a way to store Cards into a single number for easy lookups. It's
a radical form of serialization. `Cards` go in, `Bard` goes out. `Bard` goes in, `Cards` come out.

The big idea behind storing a hand in a single integer goes back to the problems that Cactus Kev was trying to solve
when he was working on his evaluator:

    _Once I determined that there were only 7462 distinct values of poker hands, I needed a way to quickly transform each 
    of the 2,598,960 unique five-card poker hands into its actual value. To complicate matters, the algorithm needed to 
    be order independant. In other words, if I pass the cards Kd Qs Jc Th 9s to my evaluator, it must generate the value 
    1601. However, if I change the order of the cards in any fashion, it must still return the value of 1601. Mixing up 
    the five cards does not change the overall value of the hand. At first, I thought that I could always simply sort 
    the hand first before passing it to the evaluator; but sorting takes time, and I didn't want to waste any CPU cycles 
    sorting hands. I needed a method that didn't care what order the five cards were given as._

    _After a lot of thought, I had a brainstorm to use prime numbers._

The product of his work was the lookup tables and permutation arrays to speed up lookups. But if I could store the hands
and results as simple integers, than I could turn the complex work that went in to Cactus Kev's method into a simple,
single database query.

### Bard to Cards

OK, now that we can collapse a collection of Cards into a single `Bard` integer, let's do the reverse,
deconstructing a binary `Bard` into a `Cards` collection. Note: one bit of information that will be
lost when going back to `Cards` from a Bard is the order of the `Cards`.

### The return of [bitvec](https://github.com/ferrilab/bitvec)

The bitvec crate was something that I had pulled out pretty early on as a way to manage the
[bitwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) operations. I loved the library a lot,
but had to remove it when the dependencies for the version I was using got pulled from
[crates.io](https://crates.io/) and the contracts behind the code radically changed going in to
version 1. I simply didn't have the time to refactor a spike version of the library that suddenly
didn't work.

Fuck it. I got it to work without it. I love this library but it's not what I'm looking for. I
got it to work via stupider methods #DumbCoder #ThisIsTheWay. See `impl From<Bard> for Cards`
for the details.

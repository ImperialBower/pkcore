# Epic 1: Calc

We are now reaching the next level of complexity with our project. Up till
now we've been focusing on the value of a poker hand in abstract, divorced from any
relationship to actual game play. Now we will need to deal with how the player's
hands relate to each other in an actual game of Hold'em. For this we will create
a new example file called calc.

When I was initially driving through this work, long before I thought it would
be interesting as a book, I created an initial version of calc. Here's how it
turned out:

```
❯ cargo run --example calc -- -n -d "6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣" -b "9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♠ 8♠"
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.06s
     Running `target/debug/examples/calc -n -d '6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣' -b '9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♠ 8♠'`
Cards Dealt: 6♠ 6♥ 5♦ 5♣ 9♣ 6♦ 5♥ 5♠ 8♠

[Seat 0: 6♠ 6♥, Seat 1: 5♦ 5♣]
[FLOP:  9♣ 6♦ 5♥, TURN:  5♠, RIVER: 8♠]

The Flop: 9♣ 6♦ 5♥
Chances of winning:
Seat #0 6♠ 6♥: 95.7% - CURRENT HAND: 6♠ 6♥ 6♦ 9♣ 5♥ HandRank { value: 2185, name: ThreeOfAKind, class: ThreeSixes }
Seat #1 5♦ 5♣: 6.0% - CURRENT HAND: 5♥ 5♦ 5♣ 9♣ 6♦ HandRank { value: 2251, name: ThreeOfAKind, class: ThreeFives }

The Nuts would be: 9♣ 8♠ 7♠ 6♦ 5♥ HandRank { value: 1605, name: Straight, class: NineHighStraight }

Possible hands at the flop, sorted by strength:
CKC #1605 9♣ 8♠ 7♠ 6♦ 5♥ HandRank { value: 1605, name: Straight, class: NineHighStraight }
CKC #1996 9♠ 9♥ 9♣ 6♦ 5♥ HandRank { value: 1996, name: ThreeOfAKind, class: ThreeNines }

## PHASE 2: Calculating Odds at Flop

Staring into the abyss. One of my gifts as a developer is a more than healthy
paranoia. Dysfunction breeds dysfunction. THE POINT??!!

## PHASE 2.1/DEFECT DETOUR

We want to display the five card hand with the winning parts first.
For that we'll need to add frequency bits to the hand and then map them.

### Cards.map_by_rank()

```
fn map_by_rank(&self) -> HashMap<Rank, Cards> {
    let mut mappie: HashMap<Rank, Cards> = HashMap::new();
    for rank in Rank::iter() {
        let pile: Vec<Card> = self.iter().map(|c| *c).filter(|card| card.get_rank() == rank).collect();
        mappie.insert(rank, Cards::from(pile));
    }
    mappie
}
```

This generates the following clippy warning:

```
warning: you are using an explicit closure for copying elements
   --> src/cards.rs:120:35
    |
120 |             let pile: Vec<Card> = self.iter().map(|c| *c).filter(|card| card.get_rank() == rank).collect();
    |                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: consider calling the dedicated `copied` method: `self.iter().copied()`
    |
    = note: `#[warn(clippy::map_clone)]` on by default
    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#map_clone
```

Don't you love Rust? This fixes it, just like the compiler said:

```
fn map_by_rank(&self) -> HashMap<Rank, Cards> {
    let mut mappie: HashMap<Rank, Cards> = HashMap::new();
    for rank in Rank::iter() {
        let pile: Vec<Card> = self.iter().copied().filter(|card| card.get_rank() == rank).collect();
        mappie.insert(rank, Cards::from(pile));
    }
    mappie
}
```

### Cards.flag_

Now we are entering into some dark magic coding. It's hacky and clunky, but for
now, I really don't care. I just want to see a hand sorted with the winning
cards first.

#### REFACTOR: Delete is_flagged_ methods and just use .is_flagged()

One of the things that I tend to do when I code is overthink things. I code
like a Java developer. I add accessors to everything. This refactoring is
me getting sick of my own code. ENOUGH! Just have a simple fn that tells you
if a mask is there and be done with it.

One could make a further refactoring argument that this is just insulating
devs from basic bitwise operations, and I'm fine with that. I really don't want
have to code `(self.as_u32() & 0bYADAYADA) == 0bYADAYADA` over and over again.
Thus `Card.is_flagged() it is.`

##### Moral

This is why tech leads and program managers are so important to a project. Coders
like me can fall down deep rabbit holes trying to bend code to our will, with
no perspective on if anyone actually gives a fuck. Yes, it would be nice to have
`Feature X` but it would be even nicer to still be in business in a month so that
we can all get paid. When I code for myself I let myself fall into
Wonderland, but when on the clock, you rarely have the luxury. Things
can always be better, faster, prettier, cooler. Push comes to shove, users rarely
care. They just want it to work.

###### Aside

My favorite example of this was when I was going with some of my coworkers to
lunch and one of the starts screaming (Brandon Zeeb and Weibe story at Ford)

## Case Evals

The breakdown:

* Eval
  * CaseEval(Vec<Eval>)
    * CaseEvals(Vec<CaseEval>)
      * Chances

An `Eval` is ...

## Phase 3: Odds at Turn

This is going to be a easier than for the flop, since there are many fewer
possible outcomes, but more importantly, because we've done most of the hard
work all ready.

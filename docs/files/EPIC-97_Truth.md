# The Source of Truth

There are few things more important for building a maintainable enterprise
than always striving to have a single source of truth. Time and time again
I have seen companies efforts grind to a halt, simply because they were so
hellbent on delivering a specific thing, that they cut this essential corner,
only to leave behind for the next poor schmuck to try to untangle the rats nest
left behind for them.

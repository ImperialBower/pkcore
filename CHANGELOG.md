# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- `AgentFidelity.prompt: Option<String>` — the reconstructed prompt text sent to
  the model, captured by arena recorders so offline cost analysis can re-tokenize
  it against a target model's tokenizer (pkdealer EPIC-44 Phase 3). Optional and
  serde-skipped when absent, so existing hand histories are unaffected.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `pokerbench` module (behind a new `pokerbench` cargo feature, off by default):
  a [PokerBench](https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench) (HuggingFace
  `RZ412/PokerBench`) scenario model and scoring for benchmarking LLM poker
  agents against solver-optimal labels (EPIC-43 Phase 1).
  - `PokerBenchScenario`, `PokerBenchAction`, `PokerBenchSplit`: a parsed 6-max
    No-Limit Hold'em decision point plus the solver-optimal action.
  - `PokerBenchScenario::load_csv` / `load_json`: loaders for the dataset's
    structured CSV columns and natural-language JSON `instruction` forms.
  - `PokerBenchScenario::canonical_seating`: resolves PokerBench position labels
    to 0-based seats (button at seat 0) with the hero seat identified, so a
    downstream seat-indexed state maps directly.
  - `score_action` / `ActionScore`: action-accuracy and pot-normalized size
    error against the optimal label (`ev_loss` reserved for a later equity pass).
  - `PB_BIG_BLIND` / `PB_EFFECTIVE_STACK`: documented conventions for fields the
    dataset does not carry (stacks, big blind).

  Analysis-only and additive: pulls in no new dependencies, changes no existing
  type, and the default build is unaffected.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `hand_history::AgentFidelity`: per-action provenance describing what an agent
  *produced* versus what the table *applied* — raw response text, a
  `was_coerced` flag, the originally intended action/amount, LLM token counts,
  and the model id. Analysis-only and ignored by `HandHistory::replay`.
- `hand_history::Action::agent`: optional `AgentFidelity` field. Skipped during
  serialization when absent, so existing YAML/JSON hand histories round-trip
  unchanged and legacy files deserialize with `agent: None`.
- `HandHistory::attach_agent_fidelity`: attaches agent metadata to a hand's
  voluntary (non-`Post`) actions in canonical order via a seat-checked
  positional zip; mismatched entries are skipped rather than misattributed.
- `HandHistory::voluntary_actions_mut`: low-level accessor returning mutable
  references to every voluntary action across all streets, for bespoke matching.

These additions are backward compatible: no existing public item changed shape
on the wire, and `replay` behavior is unaffected by the new metadata. Driven by
`ImperialBower/pkdealer` EPIC-40 Phase 4 (arena recorder agent-fidelity
annotations).
